<h3>Welcome to I2P!</h3>

<ul class="links"><li class="tidylist"><b>Starting Up&hellip;</b><br>If you've 
just started I2P, the number of <i>Active Peers</i> indicated under the 
<i>Peers</i> section in the side panel on the left should start to grow over 
the next few minutes and you'll also see a <i>Local Destination</i> named 
<i>Shared Clients</i> listed there, and possibly other clients and servers 
depending on how I2P is configured (if not, see the troubleshooting section <a 
href="#trouble">below</a>). These <i>Local Destinations</i> provide connections 
on different ports (and sometimes protocols) to the I2P network, enabling your 
bittorrent, e-mail, web proxy and other services to function. Your <a 
href="/netdb">Network Database</a> indicates all known peers on the network. 
Additionally, you can monitor existing <a href="/peers">Peer Connections</a>, 
and view existing <a href="/tunnels">Tunnels</a> and their status. More 
information is available on the <a href="/help">help page</a>.</li>

<li class="tidylist"><b>Network integration</b><br> The first time you start 
I2P it may take a few minutes to bootstrap (integrate) you into the network and 
find additional peers to optimize your integration, so please be patient. When 
I2P starts up, and during normal operation, I2P's tunnel build readiness 
indicator (immediately above the <i>Local Destinations</i> section in the 
sidepanel) may tell you that I2P is "Rejecting Tunnels"; this is normal 
behavior and should be of no cause for concern! Once green stars are indicated 
next to your <i>Local Destinations</i>, there is a wide variety of things you 
can do with I2P, and below we introduce you to some of them.</li></ul>
  
<h3>Services on I2P</h3>
<ul class="links">

<li class="tidylist"><b>Invisible Internet &amp; Public Web Browsing</b><br>On 
I2P you can access anonymous websites (eepsites) and other services (e.g. ssh 
over I2P, IRC, Jabber etc.) in addition to being able to host your own 
services. You can also access the normal web anonymously via I2P's built-in web 
proxy (outproxy). <a href="https://geti2p.net/en/about/browser-config"
target="_blank">Configure your browser</a> to use the HTTP proxy at 
<code>127.0.0.1 port 4444</code>, then browse to an eepsite or a normal, 
unencrypted <code>http://</code> address. For a pre-configured browser, you may 
wish to try <a href="http://echelon.i2p/i2pfox/">I2PFox</a>, a custom build of 
Firefox security hardened and tailored especially for I2P. If you wish to 
disable or change outproxy access to the normal internet, remove or modify the 
outproxy entry for <code>false.i2p</code> under the <i>Outproxies</i> option in 
the <a href="/i2ptunnel/edit?tunnel=0" target="_blank">I2P HTTP Proxy  Tunnel 
Editor</a>. In the "Sites of Interest" section <a href="#eepsites">below</a>, 
we list a few of the sites hosted on I2P.</li>

<!--
<li class="tidylist"><b>Anonymous E-Mail</b><br>Postman's I2P-based mail system 
can be accessed either via <a href="/susimail/susimail">I2P's built-in mail 
client</a>
  (susimail) or using any mail client that supports smtp and pop3.
  Accounts can send and receive mail from the normal internet. For an
  account, visit <a href="http://hq.postman.i2p/" 
target="_blank">hq.postman.i2p</a>.
</li>
-->

<li class="tidylist"><b>Anonymous Chat</b><br>Start your IRC client
  and connect to the server at 
<code>127.0.0.1 port 6668, 6669, or 66670</code>. You do not need to configure a proxy in your 
IRC client; I2P provides you with a local IRC tunnel (configured in your IRC 
client as an IRC server or remote host).
  Your local I2P IRC tunnel on <code>localhost:6668</code> will direct you to 
one of two IRC servers hosted on I2P by Postman and Badger, but neither you nor 
they know where the other is, and your mom, ISP or government is unable to 
intercept your conversation!
  Once you're there, 
<code>#i2p-help</code>,<code>#i2p</code>,<code>#i2p-chat</code> and 
<code>#i2p-dev</code> are just a few of the available channels you may wish to 
/join.

<h2>Troubleshooting &amp; Further Assistance</h2><a name="trouble"></a>

<ul class="links">

<li class="tidylist"><b>Be Patient!</b><br>I2P may be slow to integrate into 
network the first time you run it as it bootstraps into the network and learns 
of additional peers. The longer your I2P router is running, the better it will 
perform, so try and keep your router on as long as you can, 24/7 if possible! 
If, after 30 minutes, your <i>Active: [connected/recent]</i> count still has 
less than 10 peers, or your total number of <i>Integrated</i> peers is less 
than 5, there are several things you can do to check for problems: 
  </li>

<li class="tidylist"><b>Check Your Logs</b><br>Logs may 
help resolve a problem. You may wish to paste excerpts in a <a 
href="http://forum.i2p/viewforum.php?f=10" target="_blank">forum</a> for help, 
or perhaps <a href="http://pastethis.i2p/" target="_blank">paste</a> it 
instead and reference the link on IRC for help.
  </li> 

<li class="tidylist"><b>Getting Support Online</b><br>You may also want 
  to review the information on the <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/" 
target="_blank">I2P website</a>, 
  post messages to the <a href="http://forum.i2p/" target="_blank">I2P 
discussion forum</a>,
  or swing by
  <a href="irc://127.0.0.1:6668/i2p-help">#i2p-help</a>, <a 
href="irc://127.0.0.1:6668/i2p">#i2p</a> or <a 
href="irc://127.0.0.1:6668/i2p-chat">#i2p-chat</a> on I2P's internal IRC 
network (<code>irc.postman.i2p</code> or <code>irc.freshcoffee.i2p</code>). 
These channels are also available outside of I2P's encrypted, anonymous network 
via <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/i2p">Freenode IRC</a>.
  </li> 
  
<li class="tidylist"><b>Reporting Bugs</b><br>If you'd like to report a bug, 
please file a ticket on <a href="http://trac.i2p2.i2p/" 
target="_blank">trac.i2p2.i2p</a>. For developer-related discussions, please

<li class="tidylist"><b>Get Involved!</b><br>I2P is developed and maintained 
mostly through unfunded, voluntary participation by community members. We're 
happy to accept <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/donate.html" 
target="_blank">donations</a>, which go into essential hosting and 
administrative costs. We have <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/bounties.html" 
target="_blank">cash bounties</a> for aspects of I2P for developers looking for 
incentives to participate, and we're always looking for more <a 
href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/newdevelopers.html" target="_blank">Java coders</a>, 
<a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/newtranslators.html" 
target="_blank">translators</a>, promoters and users to help I2P grow. The 
bigger the I2P network, the more everyone benefits, so simply telling all your 
friends about I2P (and lending a hand with the installation and setup where 
needed) is a big help. For further info on how you can participate, visit the 
<a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/getinvolved.html" target="_blank">volunteers 
page</a> on the website.
