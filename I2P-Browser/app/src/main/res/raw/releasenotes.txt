General notes
-------------

The app uses a lot of RAM. Your device needs at least 256 MB of RAM. 512 should be much better.

The app may use a lot of RAM even after the router has stopped and there is no icon in the notification bar. Go to Settings -> Applications -> Running Services and stop the I2P service if necessary. Or Settings -> Applications -> Manage Applications -> Running -> I2P and force stop.

The app may be moved to the SD card. The app does not store any files on the SD card.

The app runs on either wifi or mobile networks. For now, the app is relatively low bandwidth. It allows a max of 20 participating tunnels.

The app will work best when you are not changing IPs. If you are moving around, changing wifi networks, or switching between mobile and wifi networks, it won't work well.


Advanced notes
--------------

The app uses both UDP and TCP for router-router connections, with a maximum of 32 connections on each transport by default. UPnP is enabled.

I2P's NTP is disabled for API 11 (Honeycomb) and above, as those versions include NTP support. If you have cell service, your phone or tablet should have the correct time. If you do not have cell service, ensure your device has accurate time.


Further anonymity warnings
--------------------------

* Exploratory and Client Tunnels are 2 hops by default
* Sharing IRC clients on same tunnels allows for linking
* There are .i2p DNS leaks
* Cell phones aren't exactly secure environments
* This app does not attempt to "sanitize" your phone, make you safe from Google, or capture and route traffic from any other apps over I2P
* The app does not require root or do anything with iptables, for example, to route or block traffic.
