<h2>Embedded web browser</h2>
<p>An embedded web browser is provided for convenience that will open .i2p addresses. However, it is not recommended for general use.</p>
<p>The browser does not use the outproxy for regular web sites. Javascript is disabled.</p>

<p>The following problems with eepsites are probably not fixable except on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb - i.e. tablets) and higher due to API limitations. The workaround is to use Firefox Mobile 4 and the ProxMob plugin (see below).</p>
<ol>
    <li>Leaks .i2p DNS requests</li>
    <li>Can't load cross-site images or CSS</li>
    <li>No POSTs to forms</li>
</ol>

<p>For eepsites, there are several other things to note:</p>
<ol>
    <li>No way to type in addresses</li>
    <li>Several issues with images and CSS fetches</li>
    <li>Non-HTML links (pdf, text, images, torrent, etc.) probably don't work</li>
    <li>Frame support is flaky</li>
</ol>

<p>For eepsites and websites, problems include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>No cookies</li>
    <li>History and back issues</li>
</ol>
