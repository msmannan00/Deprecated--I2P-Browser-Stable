<h2>What is this app for?</h2>
<p>I2P Android enables your device to connect to the I2P network.</p>

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>If you want to view I2P sites, see the "Browser configuration" help category.</p>
<p>With this app installed, other apps that are designed for I2P will use it automatically.</p>

<h2>Pre-configured HTTP proxy</h2>
<p>The app starts an HTTP proxy at 127.0.0.1 port 4444. To use it, configure your browser's HTTP proxy setting to use 127.0.0.1:4444.</p>
<p>The HTTP proxy is tested with the "Orweb" app. It should also work with Firefox 4 Mobile and the ProxyMob Firefox plugin, if you have at least 512 MB of RAM.</p>
<p>See the "Browser configuration" help page for more info.</p>
