<h2>What is the addressbook?</h2>
<p>The addressbook contains a list of I2P domain names and their Destinations (the I2P equivalent of an IP address).</p>
<p>Every domain name corresponds to a service. Some of these domain names may be for websites; some are not. Many of them are now defunct; when the original operator takes down a service or loses its encryption keys, the corresponding domain name is lost.</p>

<h2>How are domain names added to the addressbook?</h2>
<p>By default, the addressbook is subscribed to several I2P domain registration services. The domain names on the "Default" list are all from these services.</p>
<p>You can manually add domain names on the "Private" list.</p>
