<h2>Lightning has native I2P support!</h2>
<p>If you install Lightning after installing I2P, simply open the app. It will detect that you have I2P installed, and show a pop-up window allowing you to enable it.</p>
<p>If you installed Lightning before installing I2P, follow the steps in the next section.</p>
<p>Lightning supports both I2P and Orbot (Tor), but not at the same time. If you already use Lightning with Orbot, you will need to change it to I2P when you want to browse I2P sites.</p>
<h2>How to configure Lightning:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open Lightning's settings menu.</li>
    <li>Click on "General Settings".</li>
    <li>Change the "HTTP Proxy" to I2P.</li>
    <li>Exit the settings menu.</li>
</ol>
