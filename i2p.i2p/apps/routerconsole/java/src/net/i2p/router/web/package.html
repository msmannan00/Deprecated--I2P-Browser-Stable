The router console user interface, implemented in routerconsole.jar, with these classes
supporting the webapp in routerconsole.war.
Entry point is RouterConsoleRunner, started from clients.config.
</p><p>
Most jsp pages in the console use a "Helper" or a "Renderer" class to
assist in generating the HTML.
For configuration pages that accept changes via POST, there
is additionally a "Handler" class to process the POST data.
Helpers usually extend <a href="HelperBase.html">HelperBase</a>,
and Handlers usually extend <a href="FormHandler.html">FormHandler</a>.
The base classes are in this package, but most Helpers, Handlers, and Renderers are in
<a href="helpers/package-summary.html">the helpers package</a>.
</p><p>
This package was split in release 0.9.33, with most of the helpers and handlers
moved to net.i2p.router.web.helpers,
and moving them from routerconsole.jar to routerconsole.war.
</p><p>
No classes contained here are part of a public API.
Subject to change.
Not for public use.
