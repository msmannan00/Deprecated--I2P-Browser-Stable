Helpers and handlers for the router console user interface,
with these classes supporting the webapp in routerconsole.war.
All of these classes are packaged in routerconsole.war.
These classes are only accessible from the jsp files.
</p><p>
Most jsp pages in the console use a "Helper" or a "Renderer" class to
assist in generating the HTML.
For configuration pages that accept changes via POST, there
is additionally a "Handler" class to process the POST data.
Helpers usually extend HelperBase, and Handlers usually extend FormHandler.
</p><p>
This package was created in release 0.9.33 by moving
these classes from net.i2p.router.web to here,
and moving them from routerconsole.jar to routerconsole.war.
</p><p>
No classes contained here are part of a public API.
Subject to change.
Not for public use.
