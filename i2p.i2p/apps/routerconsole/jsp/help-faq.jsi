<h3><%=intl._t("My router has been up for several minutes and has zero or very few connections")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("If after a few minutes of uptime your router is indicating 0 Active Peers and 0 Known Peers, with a notification in the sidebar that you need to check your network connection, verify that you can access the internet.")%>
<%=intl._t("If your internet connection is functional, you may need to unblock Java in your firewall.")%>
<%=intl._t("Otherwise, you may need to reseed your I2P router. Visit the <a href=\"/configreseed#reseedconfig\">Reseed Configuration page</a> and click the \"Save Changes and Reseed Now\" button.")%></p>

<h3><%=intl._t("My router has very few active peers, is this OK?")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("If your router has 10 or more active peers, everything is fine.")%>
<%=intl._t("The router should maintain connections to a few peers at all times.")%>
<%=intl._t("The best way to stay connected to the network is to <a href=\"/config\">share more bandwidth</a>.")%></p>

<h3 id="addressbooksubs"><%=intl._t("I am missing lots of hosts in my addressbook. What are some good subscription links?")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("The default subscription is to {0} which is seldom updated.", "<code>i2p-projekt.i2p</code>")%>
<%=intl._t("If you don't have another subscription, you may use \"jump\" links which are slower, but ensure that your addressbook only contains the default addresses and sites that you use.")%>
<%=intl._t("To speed up browsing on I2P, it's a good idea to add some addressbook subscriptions.")%></p>

<p><%=intl._t("Here are some other public addressbook subscription links.")%>
<%=intl._t("You may wish to add one or two to your <a href=\"/susidns/subscriptions\">subscription list</a>.")%> 
<ul>
<li><code>http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/newhosts.txt</code></li>
<li><code>http://no.i2p/export/alive-hosts.txt</code></li>
<li><code>http://identiguy.i2p/hosts.txt</code></li>
</ul>

<p><%=intl._t("Note that subscribing to a hosts.txt service is an act of trust, as a malicious subscription could give you incorrect addresses, so be careful subscribing to lists from unknown sources.")%>
<%=intl._t("The operators of these services may have various policies for listing hosts.")%>
<%=intl._t("Presence on this list does not imply endorsement.")%></p>

<h3><%=intl._t("How do I access IRC, BitTorrent, or other services on the regular Internet?")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("Unless an outproxy has been set up for the service you want to connect to, this is not possible.")%>
<%=intl._t("There are only three types of outproxies running right now: HTTP, HTTPS, and email.")%>
<%=intl._t("Note that there is currently no public SOCKS outproxy.")%></p>

<h3><%=intl._t("How do I configure my browser to access I2P websites?")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("You will need to configure your browser to use the HTTP proxy server on host <code>127.0.0.1</code> port <code>4444</code>).")%>

<h3><%=intl._t("What is an eepsite?")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("An eepsite is a website that is hosted anonymously on the I2P network.")%>
<%=intl._t("You can access it by configuring your web browser to use I2P's HTTP proxy and browsing to the website.")%></p>

<h3><%=intl._t("Most of the eepsites are down?")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("If you consider every eepsite that has ever been created, yes, most of them are down.")%> 
<%=intl._t("People and eepsites come and go.")%>
<%=intl._t("A good way to get started in I2P is check out a list of eepsites that are currently up.")%>
<%=intl._t("{0} tracks active eepsites.",

<h3><%=intl._t("How do I connect to IRC within I2P?")%></h3>
<p><%=intl._t("A tunnel to the main IRC server network within I2P, Irc2P, is automatically started when the I2P router starts.")%>
<%=intl._t("To connect to it, tell your IRC client to connect to server: <code>127.0.0.1</code> port: <code>6668</code>.")%></p>

<p><%=intl._t("HexChat-like client users can create a new network with the server <code>127.0.0.1/6668</code>, or you can connect with the command <code>/server 127.0.0.1 6668</code>.")%>
<%=intl._t("Different IRC clients may require a different command, consult the client documentation.")%></p>
